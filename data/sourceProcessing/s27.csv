Man with Feathered Hat,ca. 1845-1847,John Frederick Kensett,American,1816,1872,graphite and watercolor on paper,"The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. Gift of Michael St. Clair","These lively figure studies reveal the working methods Kensett and Casilear employed in their costume drawings. The line to the left of the figure in Kensett's Seated Man with Small Horn represents an abandoned start to the composition. In Man with a Pipe, Casilear, or perhaps a playful classmate, added a caricature to the upper-right corner.",http://emuseum.huntington.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18171/resize:format$003dfull,1

Standing Woman with Water Jug,ca. 1845-1847,John Frederick Kensett,American,1816,1872,graphite and watercolor on paper,"The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. Gift of Michael St. Clair","Even though Kensett and Casilear were not in Rome at the same time, the similarities between their figure studies show that they were working from the same costumes, props, and models. Many of the American painters who studied in Italy during the mid-nineteenth century included costumed figures in their landscape paintings. Ten years after Kensett left Rome, American artists were continuing the practice, demonstrated by the costume studies by Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902) illustrated below.",http://emuseum.huntington.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18168/resize:format$003dfull,4
Vaudeville: Two Men,ca. 1916,Charles Demuth,American,1883,1935,watercolor and graphite on paper,"The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. Gift of Margery and Maurice Katz","Charles Demuth is best known for his dynamic paintings of fire engines and grain elevators done in a Precisionist style similar to that of Charles Sheeler (whose work is on view elsewhere in this gallery). However, he also loved New York and adopted the city's nightlife as one of his subjects. In Vaudeville: Two Men he used vivid colors and a sensuous, fluid style to depict a painted backdrop and suggest the movement of two dancers from a variety show. A deft stroke of the artist's pencil gives the dancer on the left a witty wink.",http://emuseum.huntington.org/internal/media/dispatcher/21517/resize:format$003dfull,5

Gift of Michael St. Clair","The top version of Kensett's Woman with Tambourine reflects a tight, slightly cramped style of drawing, revealing his training as an engraver. The version below shows his attempt to use a more fluid and painterly technique.",http://emuseum.huntington.org/internal/media/dispatcher/18163/resize:format$003dfull,6

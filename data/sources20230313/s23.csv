Indeed, as a major player in a spoils system that reduced the civil service to a vehicle for rewarding party faithful, he struck many as an emblem of all that was wrong in American politics. As president, however, Arthur rose above his past to promote landmark legislation designed to curb the spoils system. He also proved to be a foe of other forms of corruption. When, for example, a ""pork barrel"" bill for public improvements reached his desk, he vetoed it.  This head-and-shoulders portrait can only hint at the fashionable figure that Arthur cut. With his muttonchop whiskers ""trimmed to the perfection point"" and his suits made of only the finest fabrics, he invariably looked like the very epitome of the well-bred Victorian gentleman.

As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse. But as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to involve the federal government in reviving business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover was defeated by a crushing margin in his 1932 reelection bid. This portrait was intended for Time magazine's cover. But Hoover delayed his sittings, and by the time it was finished, the magazine was no longer interested.

Jefferson was well known to Americans in 1791, having also served as governor of Virginia and ambassador to France. Notwithstanding George Washington's desire for unity in his administration, Jefferson quickly found himself at odds with Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose power and influence on the president rivaled his own. Jefferson favored a smaller, weaker national government, with more power residing in the states, and closer ties to France; Hamilton argued for a powerful national government allied to Great Britain.

Great Britain, with its naval superiority, forbade American ships from supplying Napoleon鈥檚 armies and forced American sailors to serve in its navy (impressment). After failing to change British policy with a Non-Importation Act (1806), Congress passed Jefferson鈥檚 Embargo Act (1807), prohibiting American ships and goods from leaving port. In the final month of his presidency, Jefferson repealed the embargo and signed the Non-Intercourse Act, which reopened trade with all nations except Great Britain and France.

Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, succeeded where his father had failed by constructing the first practical reaping machine. This reaper was a first step in the mechanization of American agriculture, allowing the efficient cultivation of large tracts of farmland by small numbers of farmers. This industrialization of the land allowed the United States to boost agricultural production to unprecedented levels and to feed growing cities and industrial towns. McCormick's design was pirated by competitors, but he overcame his rivals by founding his own factory outside Chicago in 1847. There, he contributed to the pace of industrial growth by using standardized parts and assembly-line production-methods that had been pioneered by Samuel Colt and others.

With no scientific or mechanical training, Morse devised an elegant machine that sent coded messages by opening and closing an electrical circuit. While the government neglected the telegraph, private businesses seized on the new invention as a great leap forward in communications technology. At a time when railways and water transportation were binding the country together, Morse did the same with a network of instantaneous communication.

Everyone, it seemed, wanted the hero's portrait. But it is this portrait that stands for all time as the image that best represents what Washington meant to us when we were a new nation and continues to mean to us in the twenty-first century. It is the one picture that we can say ranks in importance with those sacred founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 	We see Washington in 1796, the last year of his two-term presidency. Earlier full-length portraits show him in military uniform, but here he is in civilian dress, revealing that in our democracy the elected executive is the true commander-in-chief. Standing in elegant surroundings suggesting the grandeur of European tradition, Washington is nonetheless not draped like a king, which he refused to be; he is a man powerful only by the people's consent. This was the man who told us what this new kind of leader-an elected president-could be and whose maturity and resolve gave us confidence in our future. The rainbow behind him breaks through a stormy sky. 	Washington was lucky in his portraitist, and so are we. American-born Gilbert Stuart had eighteen years in Europe to hone his artistry. He was commissioned by Senator and Mrs. William Bingham of Pennsylvania to provide a gift to the Marquis of Lansdowne, an English supporter of American independence. It was copied by Stuart and others as THE image of Washington who sustains our national purpose-the Washington every generation of Americans needs to rediscover.Gilbert Stuart (1755-1828)",1796,"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; acquired as a gift to the nation through the generosity of the Donald W.

Martha Washington convinced the president to sit again because, according to artist Rembrandt Peale, she ""wished a Portrait for herself; he therefore consented on the express condition that when finished it should be hers."" Stuart, however, preferred this portrait to his earlier Washington; he purposely left it and that of the first lady unfinished so that he could use this as a model for the numerous copies that the first president's admirers commissioned. After Stuart's death, the two paintings were purchased for the Boston Athenaeum, which owned them for more than 150 years.

This painting shows Taylor with his staff at Walnut Creek, Texas, just as hostilities broke out. The Polk administration distrusted Taylor, an outspoken Whig, fearing he would use his military career for political ends. But they could not deny the appeal of a victorious general, and Taylor was elected president in 1849 as a symbol of national unity. Sectional differences over slavery were proving intractable, however, and Taylor had a short, unhappy term as president, dying amid negotiations over the Compromise of 1850.
